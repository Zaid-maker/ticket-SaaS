## QR Code Format

Each QR code contains a unique identifier string:
```
TICKET-{purchaseId}-{timestamp}-{hash}
```

Example:
```
TICKET-cm2abc123xyz-1729012345678-a1b2c3d4
```

Components:
- `TICKET-` prefix for easy identification
- Purchase ID (unique database identifier)
- Timestamp (when QR was generated)
- 8-character hash (security validation)

## Security Features

1. **Unique Generation**: Each purchase gets a cryptographically unique QR code
2. **One-Time Use**: Once scanned, tickets cannot be reused
3. **Seller Authorization**: Only the event organizer can mark tickets as scanned
4. **Timestamp Validation**: QR codes include generation timestamps
5. **Database Tracking**: All scans are logged with timestamp
6. **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse

**Solutions**:

### For Organizers
- Test the verification system before the event
- Have backup internet connection at venue
- Train staff on using the verification page
- Have a manual verification process as backup
- Monitor for duplicate scan attempts
- Keep a device charged for scanning throughout event

### For Developers
- Regular database backups (includes QR codes)
