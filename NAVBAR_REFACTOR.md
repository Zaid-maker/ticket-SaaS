# Navbar Refactoring - Implementation Details

## Overview
This document describes the refactoring of the Navbar component to add mobile support and replace email display with user avatars.

## Changes Made

### 1. New UI Components Added

#### Avatar Component (`src/components/ui/avatar.tsx`)
- Based on Radix UI `@radix-ui/react-avatar`
- Three sub-components:
  - `Avatar`: Container for the avatar
  - `AvatarImage`: Displays the avatar image
  - `AvatarFallback`: Shows fallback content (user initials) if image fails to load
- Fully accessible with proper ARIA attributes
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for consistent design

#### Sheet Component (`src/components/ui/sheet.tsx`)
- Based on Radix UI `@radix-ui/react-dialog`
- Provides slide-out panel functionality for mobile menu
- Supports multiple positions (left, right, top, bottom)
- Configured to slide from the right for mobile navigation
- Includes overlay backdrop with smooth animations
- Fully accessible with keyboard navigation support

### 2. Utility Functions

#### `getAvatarUrl()` in `src/lib/utils.ts`
```typescript
export function getAvatarUrl(email: string): string {
  const seed = encodeURIComponent(email);
  return `https://api.dicebear.com/7.x/avataaars/svg?seed=${seed}`;
}
```
- Generates consistent, unique avatars for each user based on their email
- Uses DiceBear API (Avataaars style) for random avatar generation
- Same email always produces the same avatar (deterministic)
- Returns SVG format for fast loading and scalability

### 3. Navbar Component Refactoring (`src/components/navbar.tsx`)

#### Desktop Navigation (screens ≥ 768px)
**Before:**
- Email displayed as plain text
- Sign Out button next to email

**After:**
- User avatar (circular profile picture)
- Avatar opens dropdown menu on click
- Dropdown menu contains:
  - User email (in muted text)
  - Dashboard link with icon
  - Sign Out button with icon (red color)
- All navigation links remain in the same positions

#### Mobile Navigation (screens < 768px)
**New Implementation:**
- Hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines)
- Theme toggle still visible
- Click hamburger to open slide-out menu
- Mobile menu features:
  - User avatar and email at the top (when logged in)
  - All navigation links as full-width buttons
  - Browse Tickets
  - Dashboard (logged in)
  - Sell Tickets (logged in)
  - Sign In / Sign Up (logged out)
  - Sign Out (logged in, with icon)
- Menu closes when:
  - User clicks a link
  - User clicks the X button
  - User clicks outside the menu
  - User signs out

#### State Management
- Added `mobileMenuOpen` state to control menu visibility
- Menu state is properly reset on sign out
- Prevents body scroll when menu is open

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "@radix-ui/react-avatar": "^2.x.x",
  "@radix-ui/react-dialog": "^1.x.x"
}
```

### Icons Used (from lucide-react)
- `Menu` - Hamburger menu icon
- `User` - Dashboard link icon
- `LogOut` - Sign out button icon
- `X` - Close button icon (in Sheet component)

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Desktop navigation: `hidden md:flex` (visible on ≥768px)
- Mobile navigation: `flex md:hidden` (visible on <768px)
- Uses Tailwind's `md` breakpoint (768px)

### Accessibility Features
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Screen reader labels for icon-only buttons
- Proper ARIA attributes via Radix UI
- Focus management in dropdown and sheet menus
- Proper semantic HTML structure

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Visual Identity**: Avatar provides visual identity instead of text
2. **Space Efficiency**: Avatar takes less space than email text
3. **Mobile Friendly**: Dedicated mobile menu with touch-friendly targets
4. **Consistency**: Same avatar appears everywhere for the user
5. **Discoverability**: Dropdown menu is a common UI pattern
6. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard and screen reader support

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Desktop - Logged Out**
   - Verify "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons appear
   - Verify theme toggle works
   - Verify navigation links work

2. **Desktop - Logged In**
   - Verify avatar appears (not email text)
   - Verify avatar image loads from DiceBear API
   - Verify clicking avatar opens dropdown
   - Verify dropdown shows email, Dashboard link, and Sign Out
   - Verify Sign Out works correctly

3. **Mobile - Logged Out**
   - Verify hamburger menu appears (≤768px width)
   - Verify clicking menu opens slide-out panel
   - Verify all links are accessible in menu
   - Verify menu closes after clicking a link

4. **Mobile - Logged In**
   - Verify avatar appears in mobile menu header
   - Verify email is displayed below avatar
   - Verify all authenticated links appear
   - Verify Sign Out closes menu and logs out user

### Edge Cases
- Avatar fails to load → Fallback shows user initials
- Very long email addresses → Text truncates properly
- Rapid menu open/close → No UI glitches
- Sign out during menu open → Menu closes gracefully

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Supports both light and dark themes
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly on mobile devices

## Performance Considerations
- Avatar images are SVG (small file size)
- Images are cached by browser
- No additional API calls (DiceBear is external)
- Sheet component uses CSS animations (hardware accelerated)
- Lazy loading of auth client on sign out

## Future Enhancements
Possible improvements for future iterations:
1. Add user name to profile (in addition to email)
2. Add profile picture upload (override DiceBear avatar)
3. Add more dropdown menu options (Settings, Profile)
4. Add notification badge to avatar
5. Add transition animations to avatar image changes
6. Implement avatar image caching strategy
7. Add different avatar styles (not just Avataaars)

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Revert to previous commit: `git revert <commit-hash>`
2. Or restore old navbar by:
   - Remove Avatar and Sheet imports
   - Replace avatar with email text display
   - Remove mobile menu section
   - Remove `getAvatarUrl()` function
